The following folder contains a detailed description and implementation of Fourier Transform on English alphabet in Python  
The Fourier Transform is an important image processing tool which is used to decompose an image into its sine and cosine components. The output of the transformation represents the image in the Fourier or frequency domain, while the input image is the spatial domain equivalent. In the Fourier domain image, each point represents a particular frequency contained in the spatial domain image.  
The following folder contains 4 files:
